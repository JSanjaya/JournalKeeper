# An Electronic Journal

## The Who, What, and Why

I want to create a journal that keeps entries a
person's entries privately and securely. The 
application will allow a person to fill in the
date in their journal with their entry. The
application should allow someone to add, remove, and
edit any entries they want. There also should be a 
password to unlock the Journal so that unwanted eyes
can't see it. Since its such a generic application,
almost anyone can use it to record anything they want,
such as their personal thoughts or research notes.
Hence, this is a tool for anyone who wants to record
their thoughts/findings digitally and securely. One
could argue that you could just record your entries on
a simple notes app, so I want my project to go beyond
a simple text file and look more like a virtual
notebook that you can edit and manipulate digitally.
Traditional paper journals can be annoying sometimes
because you can't edit or delete entries without 
having to make some ugly scribbles, so I guess
this application will help save on paper.
